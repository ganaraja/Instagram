Build a Instagram-similar DApp that allows users to share image links through it. You can build this based on Ethereum testnet. The dApp has two functions:
1. Making a transaction to submit these information: (image title, image url).
2. List all shared images by getting logs from blockchain.
Bonus: enable users to like images and list images by number of likes.

Note that, sharing image is via sharing a url, and you donâ€™t have to build follow relationships.
